# EASY Grocery Tracker

The "EASY Grocery Tracker" is a web application designed to meet the basic needs of managing a grocery list in the everyday life, which can be tedious task if you are not organised. It allows users to organise their grocery items in default or customised categories and allows adding/removing items required in each category. Importantly, the users can also tick-off items from their list once they are picked up in the grocery store while out shopping, which helps make the shopping experience more efficient and also allows keeping recurring items on the list instead of removing them completely.

## UX Design
The design follows an analysis done using the five Ss: Strategy, Scope, Features, Structure, Skeleton, Surface.
The following key elements were considered in the design process:

### Strategy

#### User needs:
* Manage the grocery list centrally on a web app by tracking/adding/removing items while at the household and at the grocery store.
* Being able to add items to a list wherever they are and whenever they remember that they need something.
* Able to define the quantity and units of the items on the list.
* Easily refer back to the list by keeping items organised in categories.
* Share the list with other members of the household if needed.

#### Application goals:
* Create a user-friendly tracker that allows the users to perform basic grocery list tracking and management, including adding/removing/editing categories and items.
* Make a responsive a mobile-first design to ensure that it works well on the mobile, as the tracker is intended to be used at the grocery store while shopping to refer to and update the lists.
* Have the ability to retain lists in memory when the user resumes the app or refreshes, at least on the same device and browser.
* Having the option to share access to the list to other people or download the list in a shareable format.

#### Analysis:

| Application Feature  | Importance (scale 1-5) | Viability/Feasibility |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Create a basic application structure with section for each category and an editable list within each category | 5 | 5 |
| For better UX, the category section to show/hide on user's demand | 3 | 3 |
| Buttons are used to add/remove/tick list items and to add/remove category sections | 5 | 5 |
| Have a quantity input field and unit of measurement dropdown with input validation | 2 | 4 |
| Have a retainable list on local memory of a single device/browser | 5 | 3 |
| Give access to the list on other devices | 2 | 2 |
| Option to download/export the list in a shareable format | 3 | 3 |
| **SUM OF IMPORTANCE / VIABILITY** | **25** | **25** |

_The above analysis indicates that we are in a position to implement all features. However, we will follow an approach of implementing by order of importance/priority to ensure that the basic demands of the app are met in the timeframe and resources available._

### Scope

#### Usage Scenarios

1. Primary household shopper:
   * Adds items that are missing from their household, needed to buy from the grocery store. If a specific quantity is required, then specifies that next to the item, otherwise leaves the quantity box empty.
   * Creates a new category if any of the default ones do not represent an item, otherwise adds an item to an existing one.
   * Re-visits the list at the grocery store and ticks off items as they place them into their basket.
   * Shares the list to another household members so that they can do the shopping or edit the list themselves.

2. Secondary household member:
   * Get access to the list shared by the primary household shopper to perform any of the above tasks on the behalf of the household.
