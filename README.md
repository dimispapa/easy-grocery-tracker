# EASY Grocery Tracker

The "EASY Grocery Tracker" is a web application designed to meet the basic needs of managing a grocery list in the everyday life, which can be tedious task if you are not organised. It allows users to organise their grocery items in default or customised categories and allows adding/removing items required in each category. Importantly, the users can also tick-off items from their list once they are picked up in the grocery store while out shopping, which helps make the shopping experience more efficient and also allows keeping recurring items on the list instead of removing them completely.

## UX Design
The design follows an analysis done using the five Ss: Strategy, Scope, Features, Structure, Skeleton, Surface.
The following key elements were considered in the design process:

### Strategy

#### User needs:
* Manage the grocery list centrally on a web app by tracking/adding/removing items while at the household and at the grocery store.
* Being able to add items to a list wherever they are and whenever they remember that they need something.
* Easily refer back to the list by keeping items organised in categories.
* Post-event engagement through announcement of competition results, sharing of photos/videos and other social media posts

#### Application goals:
* Create a user-friendly tracker that allows the users to perform basic grocery list tracking and management, including adding/removing/editing categories and items.
* Make a responsive a mobile-first design to ensure that it works well on the mobile, as the tracker is intended to be used at the grocery store while shopping to refer to and update the lists.
* Have the ability to retain lists in memory when the user resumes the app or refreshes, at least on the same device and browser.
